# Project Governance

This document outlines how decisions are made and how contributors are recognized within the `ssh-c` project.

## 👥 Roles

### Project Lead

- @danijeljw (Project founder and primary maintainer)
- Oversees all technical and strategic direction

### Maintainers

- Trusted contributors with write access to the repository
- Review pull requests and triage issues
- Help enforce the code of conduct and code standards

### Contributors

- Anyone who submits code, documentation, bug reports, or feedback
- Recognized in release notes and contributor listings

## 🧭 Decision Making

All significant changes (feature design, architecture decisions, major refactors) will:

- Be proposed via an issue or discussion
- Require approval from at least one maintainer (ideally the project lead)

Pull requests will:

- Require approval from at least one maintainer
- Be merged only if all status checks pass

Disagreements are resolved through discussion and majority consensus of maintainers.

## 🛡️ Conflict Resolution

1. Attempt resolution via discussion in the PR/issue.
2. If unresolved, escalate to the project lead.
3. If still unresolved, the project lead’s decision is final.

## 🔐 Security and Ethics

The maintainers commit to responsibly addressing security concerns, following ethical disclosure, and maintaining project integrity.

## 📝 Changes to Governance

This document may be updated by consensus of the maintainers. Proposals should be submitted as pull requests with a clear rationale.
